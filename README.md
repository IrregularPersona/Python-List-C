# Python List Implementation in C

This is a rough implementation of python's list/array in C. It's able to take in 5 types of data:
    
    1. INTs (int32_t)
    2. DOUBLEs / FLOATs 
    3. CHAR's 
    4. STRINGs (char*)
    5. BOOLs

This is a continuation from the original Python List implementation in C++. All I did was just porting it into C11 and making it work (somewhat). In its current state, its still pretty rough. Still needs alot of tweaking.
